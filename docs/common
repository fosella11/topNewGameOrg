Making a Server
first 
npm init --yes

API rest modules
in the folder of the server
npm install i express morgan promise-mysql cors

If we want install the library and also it save on the package.json we have to add the command --save Example => npm i --save express

i -> install
express -> we're gonna use express to create the  server.
morgan -> para ver las peticiones y lo que ocurre en la consola 
promise-mysql -> sirve para conectar nodejs con mysql pero esto soporta promesas de javascript, async cabai 

cors -> nos permite comunicar dos servidores

TypeScript easier javascript
installing ts
npm install -g typescript
g -> global we can access after from everywhere, thanks -g :)
then wecan write on console to test 
tsc
--version--

then we can use tsc to create the config json for tsc
tsc --init

ok with tsc we can translate the js to es6
we're gonna use es6 becasue is better
and then we gonna change outDir ./build here we're gonna 
choose where the code translated from js to tsc will be 
saved.

every time that i've changed the file i have to execute tsc and then i have to use onli build to use on production

------------

in folder server we're gonna add a new script to make more easy the steps to 
create tsc...
we have to put on the part script: build: "tsc -w"
with the command -w, we are saying to the compilator that it has to continues
contraling the change and if we have changes on the code do tsc...

and then we have to execute npm run build 

So, with this we aren't gonna need do tsc, but we have to execute with node...
we can use nodemon, that is a library for debug proccess no for production 
and for this we're gonna use a -D with this command we are setting that the library it isn't in the production config anyway the command is:
npm i nodemon -D

with this command the file will be installed on the devdependecies

So now with this changes we're gonna put a new script on the configuration file on the script section, dev: "nodemon build/index.js" So we are using a console 
to execute and check change on the code: npm run build and other console to 
run npm run dev and using nodemon.

-------------------------------------------------------

other dependencie that is good to add is types, is a dependencie to help the compilator tsc and help you with the names... the dependencie will be installed on devdependencies to the command: -D the whole code is npm i @types/express -D

Important tools to use on dev
morgan and cors

npm i @types/morgan @types/cors -D

with this it is easiest control request to the server (morgan) and connect
servers (cors).

other important configs to accept format from client and sen the same

//we have to add 2 important configs more
        //first: json from express, with this option the server will be able to accept 
        // json format from client
        this.app.use(express.json());
        //The other option is for HTML format with this option from express
        this.app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false}));
